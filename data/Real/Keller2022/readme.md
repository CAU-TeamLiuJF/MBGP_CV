# Data Overview

## Phenotypes

**Climbing Bean Breeds**: In total, **VEC** consists of **290** lines, including 12 breeding groups, 4 gene pool materials, and 6 breeds (Supplementary Table 1).

**Bush Bean Breeds**: This study utilized four bush bean breeding groups: **VEF**, **MIP**, and **AxM**, with **605**, **217**, and **200** lines, respectively, having available phenotypic and genotypic data. For **ADP**, field trials were conducted in Mozambique, Tanzania, and the United States to collect phenotypic data for this study.
